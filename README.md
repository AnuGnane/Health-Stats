While there are many apps available helping people achieve their fitness goals, they usually only focus on one element like nutritional tracking or measuring activity levels, not many exist where they have a plethora of features. This can cause many people to have to use a multitude of apps to effectively manage their health.

This project aims to tackle this problem through the development of an iOS app which will combine multiple features in one space. These include calorie tracking, meal plans, overview of activity levels and an activity leaderboard to show where they stand against other users.

The project itself includes research, design, development, testing, and evaluation, producing a valuable resource for anyone seeking to effortlessly navigate their health and wellness journey, especially in a market saturated with complex health and fitness apps
